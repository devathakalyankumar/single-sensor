
Hacker Detection in Wireless Network (WSN) is of practical interest in many applications such as detecting an intruder in a battlefield. The intrusion detection is defined as a mechanism for a WSN to detect the existence of inappropriate, incorrect, or anomalous moving attackers. In this paper, we consider this issue according to heterogeneous WSN models. Furthermore, we consider two sensing detection models: single-sensing detection and multiple-sensing detection. Our simulation results show the advantage of multiple sensor heterogeneous WSNs.
This project deals with Hacker Detection in wireless network.  It is an application which was developed for security purpose,  which helps to secure our data while sharing or transferring in inter and intra networks from intruder or hacker.  The intrusion detection is defined as a mechanism for a Wireless Sensing Network (WSN) to detect existence of inappropriate, incorrect or anomalous moving attackers.
Wireless Sensing Network (WSN) detection are of two models, single sensing and multiple sensing.  At present in wireless network we can detect one intruder that is single sensing detection.
